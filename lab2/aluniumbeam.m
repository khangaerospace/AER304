% You can do all at once. But I just like it this way for now
file = readmatrix("aluminum_3_point.txt"); % out the speciment data you want %\file = readmatrix("specimen1.txt");
file2 = readmatrix("aluminum_4_point.txt");

% now create the variable
time1 = file(:,1); %[s]
MTSforce1 = file(:,2); %[N]
MTSdisp1 = file(:,3); %[mm]
LD1 = file(:,4); %[mm]
